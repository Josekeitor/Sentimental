        How does Sentimental work?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sentimental uses the Twitter API to gather tweets from a variety of Mexican cities. 
        Each of those tweets is passed through Google's Sentiment Analysis library 
        to figure out how positive or negative the tweets are. Using all of this data, 
        we created a data visualization tool to get a better understanding of the 
        public perception of the Feminist Movement in Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our data visualizer has three components: the Heatmap, the Word Cloud, 
        and the Tweet Data. The Heatmap takes the location and sentiment analysis 
        score of each tweet to look at the correlation between location and views on 
        the feminist movement; the more green you see, the more positive the tweets are. 
        The Word Cloud displays the most common words used by tweets that talk about 
        feminism in Mexico. The Tweet Data list allows you to look at the tweets 
        themselves, and they are arranged by city. You can click on any of the 
        buttons in the navigation tab on the top to look at the data.

        We hope you find our data analysis insightful!
